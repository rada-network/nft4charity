# Description

NFT4Charity is an open sourced blockchain project to help make Charity Campaigns BETTER.

Our immediate goal is the raise $1M for Covid campaigns in Vietnam. Our long term goal is to demonstrate how blockchain can make the world more transparent and open and kind.

Recently, we have seen inexperienced fundraisers who, despite their good intent, lose their reputation and in some case, being sued for fraud. With Blockchain & NFT, we can track all transactions and also make charitable campaigns more community-driven. We want to create an open source project that any one can run to raise money for their community in a Transparent way.

## Structure

Project is structure into 2 parts, frontend (FE) and backend (BE).

## Style checks

We use Prettier and ESLint to enforce a consistent code style across our codebase. For simply, let's use Prettier for formatting and Linter for catching bugs within the code. Make sure to run this first from `root` folder

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
# Run style check across all the source
yarn format:check:all

# Apply the rules
yarn format:all
```

## Running by docker-compose

```bash
# From root folder run
run_local.sh
```

### To run local, we need to have .env file

Update `.env.dev` file in `backend` folder, make sure to have values for `SENDGRID_API_KEY` and `SENTRY_DSN`

Setup the memory of you docker machine to 4GB (like image below).
