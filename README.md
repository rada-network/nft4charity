# Description

NFT4Charity is an open sourced blockchain project to help make Charity Campaigns BETTER. 

Our immediate goal is the raise $1M for Covid campaigns in Vietnam. Our long term goal is to demonstrate how blockchain can make the world more transparent and open and kind.

Recently, we have seen inexperienced fundraisers who, despite their good intent, lose their reputation and in some case, being sued for fraud. With Blockchain & NFT, we can track all transactions and also make charitable campaigns more community-driven. We want to create an open source project that any one can run to raise money for their community in a Transparent way.
